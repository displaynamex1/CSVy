description: Simple average point differential baseline

# No hyperparameters for baseline model (just calculates mean)
# This file exists for consistency

defaults:
  aggregation: mean
  groupby: team_name

notes: |
  Model 1 baseline computes average point differential per team.
  No tuning needed - just aggregation logic.
  Serves as benchmark for more complex models.
