description: ELO rating system with dynamic updates

hyperparameters:
  k_factor:
    - 16
    - 20
    - 24
    - 32
    - 40
  
  initial_rating:
    - 1400
    - 1500
    - 1600
  
  home_advantage:
    - 0
    - 50
    - 75
    - 100
    - 150
  
  mov_multiplier:
    - 0.0      # Ignore goal differential
    - 0.5
    - 1.0
    - 1.5
    - 2.0      # Heavy weight on goal differential
  
  season_carryover:
    - 0.5      # 50% regression to mean
    - 0.67
    - 0.75
    - 1.0      # Full carryover
  
  regression_mean:
    - 1400
    - 1500
    - 1600

defaults:
  k_factor: 32
  initial_rating: 1500
  home_advantage: 100
  mov_multiplier: 1.0
  season_carryover: 0.75
  regression_mean: 1500

notes: |
  K-factor: Higher = ratings change more per game (more volatile)
  
  Home advantage: Rating boost for home team (typical is 50-100)
  
  MOV multiplier: Weight margin of victory
    - 0 = only win/loss matters
    - Higher = goal differential matters more
  
  Season carryover: How much of rating to keep next season
    - 1.0 = full carryover
    - 0.67 = regress 1/3 toward mean
  
  This is important for presentation - implement from scratch!
